## General Description
This project has two components to it. The first is building a database using the files that were provided by Remo. The architecture for adding each file type to that database is included in "book_api.ipynb". Of note, at least one of each file type (.xlsx, .xml, and .mrc) was ran through this architecture, but not all files were added to the database. The code in this file must be ran before the GUI (graphical user interface), contained entirely in gui.py, can be ran and used.

## book_api.ipynb
Run this file to populate the database.

## gui.py
Run this file to interact with the database through the GUI.

## Notes
- Each individual file had to be hard coded into the database, therefore book_api.ipynb demonstrates how we initially handle the files to format them into Pandas dataframes. These dataframes were then added to the database once in a standardized format. Our team recommends this approach to achieve a standard, easy to parse format in the database.
- Not all files were uploaded to the database due to time constraints. We hope that the pipeline can be understood from the files and Pandas dataframes that were handled by this project.
